## Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
  This project aims to detect breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. It involves preprocessing the data, training the models, and evaluating their performance to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Overview
  The project utilizes a dataset containing various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension. Three different machine learning algorithms are implemented and evaluated: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

## Libraries Explanation
-NumPy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is used for numerical computations and array operations.
-Pandas: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is used to read and preprocess the breast cancer dataset.
-Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It is used to create visualizations such as histograms and box plots.
-Seaborn: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It is used to create heatmaps and visualize the confusion matrix.
-Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It is used for model training, evaluation, and preprocessing.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features extracted from breast cancer biopsies. Each row represents a biopsy, and the columns represent different features. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).
